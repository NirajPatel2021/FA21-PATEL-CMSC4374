Retrospective:<br /><br />
    lab5: <br />
        Time taken to complete assignment: 600 Minutes <br />
        I have learned how to use http callouts to load data from a local json file. I also learned how to displa images with their URL. /<br />
        The most challenging aspect of this lab for me was to iterate over the data from the json file. <br />
        I also tried to publish this page on github, but failed due to login authentication error. <br />
        This assignment has increased my familiarity with Angular. I also learned another way to store and load data.  <br /> <br />
    lab4: <br />
        Time taken to complete assignment: 600 Minutes <br />
        I have learned how to create custom APIs using Spring. More specifically, I learned how to create the Get, Post, and Put Methods.<br />
        I was able to test these methods using the Postman application, and they were successful. <br />
        The next step would be to incorporate these methods into angular components. <br />
        This assignment has significantly improved my skills in Spring, thus enhancing my ability to make comprehensive websites.  <br /> <br />
    lab_3: <br />
        Time taken to complete assignment: 480 Minutes <br />
        I have learned that Angular is useful in making websites with smooth navigation. It makes a website look and feel like an application. <br />
        This lab took really long because I wanted to create a custom API with my own data. Figuring out a way to do this took about 2-3 hours. <br />
        I ended up using Retool, a REST API generator, to achieve this. <br />
        This assignment has significantly improved my skills in Angular, more specifically, creating and managing components.  <br /> <br />
    lab_2: <br />
        Time taken to complete assignment: 300 Minutes <br />
        I have learned that a servlet is useful in manipulating input that is provided by the user. <br />
        This lab took much longer than I estimated because of Tomcat configuration problems. <br />
        While it was probably not the goal of this assignment, this has greatly improved my ability to use Tomcat. <br /> <br />
    lab_1: <br />
        Time taken to complete assignment: 180 Minutes <br />
        I have learned that an XmlHttpRequest is useful because it updates the webpage live. <br />
        I simply have to update any info in my code files, and it will instantly update the webpage. <br />
        This is a great way to save/load data, but I still prefer SQL because of their data tables. <br />
