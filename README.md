Retrospective:<br /><br />
    lab_3: <br />
        Time taken to complete assignment: 480 Minutes <br />
        I have learned that Angular is useful in making websites with smooth navigation. It makes a website look and feel like an application. <br />
        This lab took really long because I wanted to create a custom API with my own data. Figuring out a way to do this took about 2-3 hours. <br />
        I ended up using Retool, a REST API generator to achieve this. <br />
        This assignment has significantly improved my skills in Angular, more specifically, creating and managing components.  <br /> <br />
    lab_2: <br />
        Time taken to complete assignment: 300 Minutes <br />
        I have learned that a servlet is useful in manipulating input that is provided by the user. <br />
        This lab took much longer than I estimated because of Tomcat configuration problems. <br />
        While it was probably not the goal of this assignment, this has greatly improved my ability to use Tomcat. <br /> <br />
    lab_1: <br />
        Time taken to complete assignment: 180 Minutes <br />
        I have learned that an XmlHttpRequest is useful because it updates the webpage live. <br />
        I simply have to update any info in my code files, and it will instantly update the webpage. <br />
        This is a great way to save/load data, but I still prefer SQL because of their data tables. <br />
